        Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the 
        Web has to offer. They've been a feature of the Web 
        since the beginning, and are what makes the Web a web.
        Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other 
        documents or resources, link to specific parts of 
        documents, or make apps available at a web address. 
        Almost any web content can be converted to a link so 
        that when clicked or otherwise activated the web browser 
        goes to another web address (URL).

    <p>
        External Links are hyperlinks that point at (target) any 
        domain other than the domain the link exists on (source).
        In layman's terms, if another website links to you, this is 
        considered an external link to your site. Similarly, 
        if you link out to another website, 
        this is also considered an external link.

    <h2 id="in">Internal Hyperlink</h2>
    <p>HTML internal link is linked within the same web page. 
        This link can be an absolute path or relative path.
        HTML internal link name is followed by the hash sign(#). 
        You have to assign an id to refer section of your page, 
        which is referred to as an internal link to the same page.
        When you click on an internal anchor link, you will scroll
         automatically to the referred section and display it on 
         your browser.
